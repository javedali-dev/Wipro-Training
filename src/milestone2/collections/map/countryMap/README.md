1. Develop a java class with a instance variable CountryMap  HashMap (M1)
   add a method saveCountryCapital(String CountryName, String capital),     
   the method should add the passed country and capital as key/value in the map M1 and return the Map (M1).
  
    |Key- Country|Value - Capital|
    |------------|---------------|
    |India        | Delhi|
    |Japan   |   Tokyo|
2. Develop a method getCapital(String CountryName) which returns the capital for the  country passed from the Map M1 created in step 1.
3. Develop a method getCountry(String capitalName) which returns the country for the capital name passed from the Map M1 created in step 1.
4. Develop a method which iterates through the map M1 and creates another map M2 with Capital as the key and value as Country and returns the Map M2.
   
    |Key- Country|Value - Capital|
   |------------|---------------|
   |India        | Delhi|
   |Japan   |   Tokyo|
5. Develop a method which iterates through the map M1 and creates an ArrayList with all
   the Country names stored as keys. This method should return the ArrayList. 
   >NOTE: You can test the methods using a main method.
