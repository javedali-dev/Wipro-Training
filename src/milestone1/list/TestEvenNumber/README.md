Develop a java class with a method saveEvenNumbers(int N) using ArrayList to store even numbers from 2 to N, where N is a integer which is passed as a parameter to the method saveEvenNumbers().  
The method should return the ArrayList (A1) created. In the same class create a method printEvenNumbers()which iterates through the arrayList A1 in step 1,  and It should multiply each number with 2 and display it in format 4,8,12….2*N. and add these numbers in a new ArrayList (A2).
The new ArrayList (A2) created needs to be returned. Create a method printEvenNumber(int N)  parameter is a number N. This method should search the arrayList (A1) for the existence of the number ‘N’ passed.  If exists it should return the Number else return zero.Hint:  Use instance variable for storing the ArrayList A1 and A2.
NOTE: You can test the methods using a main method.
